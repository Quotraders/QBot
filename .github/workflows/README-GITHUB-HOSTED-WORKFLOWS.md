# GitHub-Hosted Bot Launch Workflows

## Overview

All bot launch workflows have been upgraded to run on **GitHub-hosted runners** (ubuntu-latest) instead of self-hosted runners. This allows you to:

- ‚úÖ Launch the bot from anywhere without requiring a self-hosted runner
- ‚úÖ Connect to TopstepX API with full credentials
- ‚úÖ View comprehensive logs directly in GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ Debug issues without needing local infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Download artifacts for detailed analysis

## Available Workflows

5. Enable/disable DRY_RUN mode
6. View comprehensive diagnostics in artifacts

### 3. üöÄ Bot Execution Test
**File**: `.github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml`

**Purpose**: Simple bot execution test (formerly self-hosted, now GitHub-hosted).

**Features**:
- Quick 5-minute test run
- Basic log capture
- Error detection
- Simple success/failure reporting

**How to Use**:
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Bot Execution Test
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Set timeout minutes (default: 5)
4. Enable/disable DRY_RUN mode
5. View execution summary

## Required Secrets

All workflows require the following GitHub secrets to be configured in your repository settings:

### TopstepX Credentials
- `TOPSTEPX_API_KEY` - Your TopstepX API key
- `TOPSTEPX_USERNAME` - Your TopstepX username/email
- `TOPSTEPX_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your TopstepX account ID
- `TOPSTEPX_ACCOUNT_NAME` - Your TopstepX account name (optional)

### How to Set Secrets
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add each secret with its value
5. Save

## Workflow Configuration

### Environment Variables
All workflows automatically configure:
- TopstepX API endpoints
- DRY_RUN mode (paper trading)
- Enhanced learning features
- Model registry and promotion
- Logging levels

### .NET Environment
- .NET SDK 8.0.x is automatically installed
- All NuGet packages are restored
- Solution is built in Release mode
- UnifiedOrchestrator is the entry point

### Artifacts
Each workflow uploads artifacts containing:
- **Console logs**: Complete bot output
- **Error logs**: Stderr output
- **System info**: Environment details (JSON)
- **Structured logs**: Parsed events and metrics (JSON)
- **Execution summary**: Final report

Artifacts are retained for 30 days and can be downloaded from the Actions tab.

## Viewing Logs

### Real-Time Logs
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Select your workflow run
2. Click on the job name (e.g., "Launch Trading Bot")
3. Expand the "üöÄ Launch Trading Bot" step
4. View streaming logs in real-time

### Downloaded Artifacts
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Select your workflow run
2. Scroll to the bottom "Artifacts" section
3. Click on the artifact name (e.g., "bot-logs-run-123")
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Open log files with any text editor

## Debugging Issues

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Required TopstepX credentials are missing"
- **Solution**: Ensure all required secrets are set in repository settings

**Issue**: "Build failed"
- **Solution**: Check the build logs for compilation errors. May indicate missing dependencies.

**Issue**: "Process exited immediately"
- **Solution**: Download artifacts and check console/error logs for startup failures

**Issue**: "Bot execution timeout"
- **Solution**: This is expected! The bot runs continuously, so timeout means it ran for the configured duration.

### Log Analysis
Check the console logs for these patterns:
- `‚úÖ` - Success indicators
- `‚ùå` - Error indicators
- `‚ö†Ô∏è` - Warning indicators
- `[STARTUP]` - Startup events
- `[CRITICAL]` - Critical errors
- `STDERR:` - Error stream output

## Safety Features

### DRY_RUN Mode
- Enabled by default in all workflows
- Uses real market data but simulates trades
- No real money at risk
- Can be disabled via workflow input (use with caution!)

### LIVE_ORDERS
- Always set to `0` in workflow configurations
- Prevents accidental live trading
- Manual override required for live trading

### Timeout Protection
- All workflows have maximum runtime limits
- Prevents runaway processes
- Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM
- Force kill with SIGKILL if needed

## Migration from Self-Hosted

If you were previously using self-hosted runners:

### What Changed
- ‚úÖ Runs on GitHub-hosted ubuntu-latest runners
- ‚úÖ No PowerShell - all bash scripts
- ‚úÖ Credentials from GitHub secrets (not .env file)
- ‚úÖ Simplified environment setup
- ‚úÖ Consistent Linux environment

### What Stayed the Same
- ‚úÖ Same bot functionality
- ‚úÖ Same TopstepX connectivity
- ‚úÖ Same safety features (DRY_RUN, kill switches)
- ‚úÖ Same logging capabilities

### Advantages of GitHub-Hosted
1. **No infrastructure required**: No need to maintain self-hosted runners
2. **Consistent environment**: Same Linux environment every time
3. **Better security**: Credentials stored in GitHub secrets
4. **Easier debugging**: Logs and artifacts automatically available
5. **Cost effective**: Included in GitHub Actions free tier

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Starting
- Check that all required secrets are set
- Verify you have write permissions to Actions
- Ensure workflow is enabled in repository settings

### Bot Fails to Connect to TopstepX
- Verify TopstepX credentials are correct
- Check API key is not expired
- Ensure account ID matches your TopstepX account
- Review error logs for specific connection errors

### Build Failures
- Check for .NET SDK version compatibility
- Review NuGet package restore logs
- Verify all project references are valid
- Check for code compilation errors

### Runtime Errors
- Download and review console logs
- Check error logs for exceptions
- Review structured logs for event sequence
- Look for TopstepX API errors

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Review the logs and artifacts first
2. Check the troubleshooting section above
3. Search GitHub Issues for similar problems
4. Create a new issue with:
   - Workflow run link
   - Downloaded artifacts (sanitize sensitive data!)
   - Description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce

## Best Practices

1. **Always test with DRY_RUN first**
2. **Start with short runtime (5 minutes) for testing**
3. **Use Debug log level when investigating issues**
4. **Download artifacts for detailed analysis**
5. **Monitor TopstepX account activity**
6. **Review logs after each run**
7. **Keep secrets secure and rotate regularly**
