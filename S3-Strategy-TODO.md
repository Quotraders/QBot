# S3 Strategy TODO

## Improvements & Enhancements

- Integrate S3 config loading with main config loader for unified management
- Add advanced error handling for config file issues
- Add logging for session gating and trade attempts
- Write unit tests for S3 logic and config parsing
- Refactor S3 method to reduce cognitive complexity (address lint warning)
