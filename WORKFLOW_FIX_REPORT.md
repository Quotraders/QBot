# Self-Hosted Bot Workflow Fix Report

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Workflows Fixed**: `selfhosted-bot-run.yml`, `bot-launch-diagnostics.yml`

## Executive Summary

Fixed critical cross-platform compatibility issues in self-hosted GitHub Actions workflows that would prevent execution on macOS self-hosted runners. Also fixed a workflow syntax error that would cause job failures.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cross-Platform `stat` Command Incompatibility ✅

**Severity**: High (Would fail on macOS runners)  
**Files**: 
- `.github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml` (line 127)
- `.github/workflows/bot-launch-diagnostics.yml` (line 267)

**Problem**: 
The workflows used Linux-only `stat -c%s` command to get file size, which fails on macOS self-hosted runners where the command is `stat -f%z`.

```bash
# Before (Linux only) - FAILS ON macOS
FILE_SIZE=$(stat -c%s "$DLL_PATH" 2>/dev/null)

# After (Cross-platform) - WORKS ON BOTH
FILE_SIZE=$(stat -c%s "$DLL_PATH" 2>/dev/null || stat -f%z "$DLL_PATH" 2>/dev/null)
```

**Impact**: 
- Workflow would fail at "Verify Build Output" step on macOS runners
- Build artifacts exist but verification fails, blocking workflow execution
- Same pattern was already used correctly in `bot-launch-github-hosted.yml`

**Solution**: 
Added fallback to try Linux format first, then macOS format if Linux fails. This matches the pattern used in the working `bot-launch-github-hosted.yml` workflow.

### 2. GitHub Actions Expression Syntax Error ✅

**Severity**: Critical (Causes workflow parse failure)  
**File**: `.github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml` (line 28)

**Problem**: 
Invalid GitHub Actions expression syntax attempting arithmetic operation in expression context.

```yaml
# Before (SYNTAX ERROR)
timeout-minutes: ${{ fromJSON(github.event.inputs.timeout_minutes || '5') + 5 }}
# Error: got unexpected character '+' while lexing expression
```

**Root Cause**: 
GitHub Actions expressions don't support arithmetic operators directly. The `+` operator is not valid in expression syntax. To perform arithmetic, you need to use functions or calculate in a step.

**Solution**: 
Simplified to fixed timeout value that covers the workflow's intended use case:

```yaml
# After (FIXED)
timeout-minutes: 15  # Covers max runtime + startup/shutdown buffer
```

**Justification**:
- Workflow is designed for quick test runs (default 5 minutes)
- 15 minute timeout provides adequate buffer for startup + 5-10 min runtime + shutdown
- Matches the pattern used in `bot-launch-github-hosted.yml` (70 min fixed timeout)
- Removes complexity and potential for expression parsing errors

---

### 3. Improved .gitignore ✅

**Severity**: Low (Housekeeping)  
**File**: `.gitignore`

**Problem**: 
Auto-generated model promotion files were being committed to the repository.

**Solution**: 
Added `model_registry/promotions/` to .gitignore to prevent committing runtime-generated promotion metadata.

```gitignore
# ONNX models and ML artifacts (prevent accidental commits)
*.onnx
artifacts/
artifacts/*/
models/
model_registry/promotions/  # Added
```

---

## Validation

### actionlint Results

```bash
$ actionlint .github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml
✅ No syntax errors (only pre-existing shellcheck style warnings)

$ actionlint .github/workflows/bot-launch-diagnostics.yml  
✅ No syntax errors (only pre-existing shellcheck style warnings)
```

**Note**: Remaining shellcheck warnings (SC2181, SC2046, SC2086) are pre-existing style suggestions and don't affect functionality.

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test cross-platform stat command
$ DLL_PATH="src/UnifiedOrchestrator/bin/Release/net8.0/UnifiedOrchestrator.dll"
$ FILE_SIZE=$(stat -c%s "$DLL_PATH" 2>/dev/null || stat -f%z "$DLL_PATH" 2>/dev/null)
$ FILE_SIZE_MB=$(awk "BEGIN {printf \"%.2f\", $FILE_SIZE / 1048576}")
$ echo "✅ Build artifacts verified"
$ echo "   UnifiedOrchestrator.dll: $FILE_SIZE_MB MB"

✅ Build artifacts verified
   UnifiedOrchestrator.dll: 1.40 MB
```

### Bot Launch Verification

```bash
$ dotnet run --project src/UnifiedOrchestrator/UnifiedOrchestrator.csproj -c Release

✅ Unified trading system initialized successfully - SDK Ready: False
```

Bot launches successfully despite expected errors (Python SDK not installed, adapter not running - normal for CI environment).

---

## Expected Behavior in CI/CD

The following errors in bot logs are **expected and properly handled** in CI environments:

### Expected Errors (Not Issues)
1. ❌ `[SDK-VALIDATION] project-x-py SDK not found`
   - **Expected**: Python SDK not installed in CI
   - **Handled**: Bot continues without SDK, uses fallback data sources
   
2. ❌ `Connection refused (localhost:8765)`  
   - **Expected**: SDK adapter not running in CI
   - **Handled**: Historical data bridge gracefully degrades
   
3. ❌ `GitHub API request failed: Unauthorized`
   - **Expected**: No GitHub token in workflow environment
   - **Handled**: Cloud model sync skips download, uses local models
   
4. ⚠️ `Failed to load model from: models/rl_model.onnx`
   - **Expected**: ONNX models not checked into repository
   - **Handled**: Model ensemble uses fallback algorithms

### Success Indicators
✅ `Unified trading system initialized successfully`  
✅ `Build artifacts verified`  
✅ `Bot executed successfully` (or timeout after configured duration)

## Testing Recommendations

### For Self-Hosted Runners

1. **Linux Runner** (Ubuntu/Debian)
   ```bash
   # Test workflow
   gh workflow run selfhosted-bot-run.yml --ref <branch>
   
   # Verify stat command works
   stat -c%s <file>  # Should succeed
   ```

2. **macOS Runner**
   ```bash
   # Test workflow
   gh workflow run selfhosted-bot-run.yml --ref <branch>
   
   # Verify fallback works
   stat -c%s <file> 2>/dev/null || stat -f%z <file>  # Should succeed via fallback
   ```

3. **Windows Runner** (if using Git Bash/WSL)
   ```bash
   # Test workflow
   gh workflow run selfhosted-bot-run.yml --ref <branch>
   
   # May need additional stat command handling for native Windows
   ```

## Production Deployment Checklist

For full production deployment with real trading:

- [ ] TopstepX Python SDK installed: `pip install 'project-x-py[all]'`
- [ ] SDK adapter configured and running on localhost:8765
- [ ] Network access to api.topstepx.com verified
- [ ] Valid TopstepX credentials in GitHub secrets:

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ All critical workflow issues resolved

The self-hosted bot workflows now support both Linux and macOS runners and have correct syntax for GitHub Actions expressions. The bot launches successfully in CI environments with expected, gracefully-handled errors for missing optional dependencies.

**Next Steps**:
1. Merge this PR to apply fixes
2. Test on actual self-hosted runner (both Linux and macOS if available)
3. Monitor workflow runs for any remaining issues
4. Consider adding Windows-specific stat handling if Windows runners are used
