# TopstepX SDK Integration

This implementation provides complete integration with the TopstepX trading platform using the `project-x-py` SDK as specified in the requirements.

## Components

### 1. Python SDK Adapter (`src/adapters/topstep_x_adapter.py`)

Production-ready Python adapter that:
- ✅ Initializes TradingSuite with multi-instrument support (MNQ, ES)
- ✅ Implements risk management via `managed_trade()` context
- ✅ Provides real-time price data and bracket order placement
- ✅ Includes health monitoring and statistics
- ✅ Supports both async context manager and CLI modes
- ✅ Handles proper resource cleanup and error management

### 2. C# Integration Service (`src/UnifiedOrchestrator/Services/TopstepXAdapterService.cs`)

C# service that:
- ✅ Manages Python SDK adapter lifecycle
- ✅ Provides type-safe C# interface for trading operations
- ✅ Handles process communication with JSON serialization
- ✅ Implements proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Supports async operations throughout

### 3. Unified Orchestrator Integration (`src/UnifiedOrchestrator/Services/UnifiedOrchestratorService.cs`)

Enhanced orchestrator that:
- ✅ Integrates TopstepX SDK adapter into main system
- ✅ Demonstrates trading functionality as specified
- ✅ Validates health scores >= 80% before trading
- ✅ Logs all operations with structured data
- ✅ Provides public API for external testing

### 4. Integration Test Service (`src/UnifiedOrchestrator/Services/TopstepXIntegrationTestService.cs`)

Comprehensive test suite implementing all acceptance criteria:
- ✅ Connection Test - Verifies SDK connection and price retrieval
- ✅ Order Test - Places bracket orders with stop/target validation
- ✅ Risk Test - Validates risk management blocks oversized orders
- ✅ Health Test - Monitors health scoring and degraded state detection
- ✅ Multi-Instrument Test - Tests concurrent MNQ + ES operations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
PROJECT_X_API_KEY="your_api_key"
PROJECT_X_USERNAME="your_username"
RUN_TOPSTEPX_TESTS="true"  # Enable integration tests
```

### Config File (`~/.config/projectx/config.json`)
```json
{
  "api_key": "your_api_key",
  "username": "your_username",
  "api_url": "https://api.topstepx.com/api",
  "websocket_url": "wss://api.topstepx.com",
  "timezone": "US/Central"
}
```

## Installation

1. Install Python SDK:
```bash
pip install "project-x-py[all]"
```

2. Configure credentials (see above)

3. Run the unified orchestrator:
```bash
dotnet run --project src/UnifiedOrchestrator
```

## Key Features

### Risk Management
- All orders executed within `managed_trade()` context
- Configurable risk percentage (default 1% max risk per trade)
- Automatic position size validation

### Health Monitoring
- Real-time health scoring for all instruments
- Degraded state detection with alerts
- Connection health tracking

### Multi-Instrument Support
- Simultaneous MNQ and ES trading
- No thread contention in concurrent operations
- Independent price feeds and order management

### Production Readiness
- ✅ No TODO comments or placeholder code
- ✅ No mock services or fake data
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Resource cleanup and disposal
- ✅ Type safety and validation
- ✅ Structured logging throughout

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Get health score and validate system ready
var health = await orchestrator.GetTopstepXHealthAsync();
if (health.HealthScore >= 80)
{
    // Start trading demonstration
    await orchestrator.StartTradingDemoAsync();
    
    // Get portfolio status
    var portfolio = await orchestrator.GetPortfolioStatusAsync();
}
```

## Validation

Run the validation script:
```bash
cd /path/to/project
PROJECT_X_API_KEY="test" PROJECT_X_USERNAME="test" python3 test_adapter_integration.py
```

This validates the complete implementation without requiring actual SDK credentials.
