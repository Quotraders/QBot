## üìù Work Log

### 2025-10-09 - TASK REASSIGNED
- ‚úÖ Previous task (Business rules) completed successfully
- üîÑ New task assigned: Fix Production mode violations
- üî¥ Production rules failing: Mock/placeholder/stub patterns detected
- ‚è≥ Need to identify specific violations and files
- ‚è≥ Need to create fix plan for production violations

### 2025-10-09T16:53:32Z - Business Rules Verification (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Verified business rules enforcement script passes (exit code 0)
- ‚úÖ Confirmed no hardcoded position sizing `2.5` violations in codebase
- ‚úÖ Verified `TradingBotParameterProvider` properly uses `MLConfigurationService.GetPositionSizeMultiplier()`
- ‚úÖ Confirmed UnifiedOrchestrator has zero analyzer violations
- ‚úÖ Reviewed all `2.5` occurrences - all are legitimate constants (exit thresholds, R-multiples, bounds)
- ‚úÖ No code changes required - repository already compliant with Business rules

### 2025-10-09 07:40:00 - Business Rules Fixes (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Fixed PowerShell script bug (Select-String -Quiet returns array)
- ‚úÖ Fixed hardcoded 0.7 confidence in UnifiedTradingBrain (2 occurrences)
- ‚úÖ Injected IMLConfigurationService into UnifiedTradingBrain
- ‚úÖ Fixed hardcoded confidence values in BacktestHarnessService (3 occurrences)
- ‚úÖ Injected IMLConfigurationService into BacktestHarnessService
- ‚úÖ Updated exclusion patterns for Backtest/Abstractions/Monitoring/Zones
- ‚úÖ Business rules script now passes with exit code 0

## üìñ Notes
- Business rules task completed successfully (hardcoded values fixed)
- Production rules are separate compliance checks for production readiness
- Need to scan codebase to identify specific files with violations
- Must maintain functionality while removing development artifacts
