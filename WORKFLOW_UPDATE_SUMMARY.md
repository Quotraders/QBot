# Workflow Update Summary

## Changes Made (Commit: 555b735)

### Problem Addressed
User requested:
1. Make sure workflow can grab credentials from .env file (API key, username, account ID)
2. Have workflow run after each commit to PR so updates can be tested without merging to main

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Workflow Trigger Update
**Before:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'copilot/fix-trading-bot-errors'
```

**After:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'copilot/fix-bot-code-errors'  # Current PR branch
```

**Impact:** Workflow now runs automatically on every commit to this PR branch.

#### 2. Environment Setup - Preserve .env File
**Before:**
- Workflow created new .env file from GitHub secrets
- Secrets were empty, so .env got overwritten with empty values
- This caused credentials to be lost

**After:**
- Workflow checks if .env file exists and preserves it
- No longer overwrites .env file
- Bot uses existing credentials from .env on self-hosted runner

**Code Change:**
```powershell
# Check if .env file already exists (on self-hosted runner)
if (Test-Path ".env") {
  Write-Output "‚úÖ Found existing .env file - preserving it"
  Write-Output "   This file contains the credentials needed for bot operation"
} else {
  Write-Output "‚ö†Ô∏è No .env file found - this may cause credential issues"
  Write-Output "   On self-hosted runner, .env file should exist with credentials"
}
```

#### 3. Bot Run Step - Load from .env
**Before:**
- Set environment variables from secrets (which were empty)
- These empty variables overrode .env values

**After:**
- No environment variables set from secrets
- Bot explicitly loads from .env file
- Credentials come from .env on self-hosted runner

**Code Change:**
```powershell
# Load environment variables from .env file if it exists
if (Test-Path ".env") {
  Write-Output "üìã Loading environment variables from .env file..."
  Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_ -match '^([^#][^=]+)=(.*)$') {
      $key = $matches[1].Trim()
      $value = $matches[2].Trim()
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($key, $value)
    }
  }
  Write-Output "‚úÖ Environment variables loaded from .env"
}
```

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml` - 18 insertions, 38 deletions

### Testing
1. **Automatic Execution:** Workflow will run on this commit (555b735)
2. **Credential Loading:** Bot will read from .env file on self-hosted runner
3. **Expected Behavior:** 
   - Workflow starts automatically
   - Bot loads credentials from .env
   - TopstepX connection succeeds
   - Bot executes for 7 minutes (timeout)

### Benefits
‚úÖ **Auto-run on commits** - No manual workflow triggering needed
‚úÖ **Uses existing credentials** - No need to configure GitHub secrets
‚úÖ **Preserves .env** - Credentials stay on self-hosted runner
‚úÖ **Simpler workflow** - Less code, clearer logic
‚úÖ **Better logging** - Clear messages about .env usage

### Security
- ‚úÖ .env file never committed to repo
- ‚úÖ Credentials stay on self-hosted runner
- ‚úÖ No credential exposure in workflow logs
- ‚úÖ Proper separation of concerns

### Next Steps
1. Wait for workflow to run automatically on this commit
2. Check workflow logs to verify .env file is preserved
3. Verify bot successfully connects with credentials from .env
4. If successful, merge PR to main
