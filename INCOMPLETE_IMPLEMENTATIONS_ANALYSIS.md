---

## üìä SUMMARY BY PRIORITY

| Priority | Count | Action Required |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| üî¥ CRITICAL (Disabled) | 3 | ‚úÖ None - already disabled |
| üü† HIGH (Review) | 2 | Verify registration and functionality |
| üü° MEDIUM | 3 | Review when implementing features |
| üü¢ LOW | 22+ | Optional - review as needed |

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Before Launch)

1. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Verify disabled services stay disabled
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO:** Check if CloudDataIntegrationService is registered
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO:** Check if WorkflowOrchestrationManager is registered

### First Week

4. Verify EmergencyExitExecutor functionality (safety critical)
5. Review StuckPositionMonitor implementation
6. Test ES_NQ_CorrelationManager if using correlation features

### First Sprint

7. Review remaining 22+ files on case-by-case basis
8. Implement or remove incomplete features
9. Update documentation for architectural notes

---

## üí° INTERPRETATION GUIDE

### What "Implementation would" Usually Means:

1. **Architecture Note:** "This would integrate with X" = Design documentation
2. **Future Feature:** "This would add caching" = Enhancement not yet implemented  
3. **Stub Method:** "Implementation would return data" = Method needs implementation
4. **Helper Comment:** "This would use existing service" = Integration point note

### Risk Assessment:

- ‚úÖ **Architecture notes** in working services = LOW RISK
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stub methods** in registered services = MEDIUM RISK (needs verification)
- üî¥ **Stub methods** returning empty data = HIGH RISK (if used)
- ‚úÖ **Stubs in disabled services** = NO RISK

---

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

For each file with "would" comments:

- [ ] Is the service registered in DI?
- [ ] Is the method/feature actually called?
- [ ] Does the service have other working implementations?
- [ ] Is this just an architectural note/comment?
- [ ] Is incomplete functionality blocking any feature?

---

**Conclusion:** Most "Implementation would" comments are architectural notes or optional features. Only 2-3 need immediate verification (CloudDataIntegration, WorkflowOrchestration). The rest are low-priority or in disabled services.
