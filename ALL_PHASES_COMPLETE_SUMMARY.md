   - R-multiple calculation (profit relative to initial risk)

2. ✅ **Volatility-Adaptive Stops**
   - High volatility (ATR > 1.5x avg) → Widen stops by 20%
   - Low volatility (ATR < 0.7x avg) → Tighten stops by 20%
   - Session-aware adjustments (Asia vs RTH vs ETH)
   - VIX integration ready (widen when VIX > 20)

3. ✅ **Dynamic State Tracking**
   - Property dictionary for tracking partial exits
   - Helper methods: HasProperty(), GetProperty(), SetProperty()
   - Tracks: Partial exit execution status, Volatility adjustment timing

4. ✅ **Smart Adjustment Logic**
   - Adjusts at most once per 5 minutes
   - Only updates stops in favorable direction
   - Calculates optimal stop distance based on volatility ratio

### Example Scenarios
```
Perfect Trade:
Entry: 5000.00, Stop: 4990.00 (10 ticks = 1R)
├─ 5015.00 (+1.5R) → Close 50%
├─ 5025.00 (+2.5R) → Close 30%
└─ 5040.00 (+4.0R) → Close 20%
Result: Weighted avg +22.5 ticks vs +10 ticks single target

High Volatility:
Entry: 5000.00, Stop: 4990.00
ATR: 18 ticks (vs avg 12 = 1.5x)
└─ Widen stop to 4988.00 (12 ticks from entry)
Result: Avoid premature stop-out in volatile market
```
