Stub Scan Report
Generated: 2025-08-25 16:22 local time (updated)

Scope
Re-scanned the repository for stubs after implementing missing logic.

Summary
- Critical stubs: none.
- Actionable placeholders: resolved by implementation.
- Benign stubs: none remaining that affect runtime.

Resolved items
1) src\MarketDataAgent\BarAggregator.cs — Implemented full time-bucket aggregation (OnTrade/OnQuote → BotCore.Models.Bar, OnBar event).
2) src\RiskAgent\ModelsAndRisk.cs — Added ATR and simple RiskSizer utilities.
3) src\PositionAgent\PositionAgent.cs — Implemented OnOrder parsing/logging.
4) src\BotCore\ExampleWireUp.cs — Implemented minimal wiring helper.
5) src\BotCore\HistoryApi.cs — Implemented HistoryApi using ApiClient.
6) src\BotCore\UserHubClient.cs — Implemented lightweight event façade.
7) src\OrchestratorAgent\OrchestratorAgent.cs — Removed stray placeholder comments.

Notes
- Duplicate alternative UserHubAgent mentioned previously under OrchestratorAgent not found; primary UserHubAgent lives under BotCore and is used by Program.
- Build: OK. Tests discovery via runner tool did not execute; compile-only verification passed.

Status: No unresolved stubs impacting functionality.
