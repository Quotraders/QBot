EMERGENCY DATA GENERATOR - REMOVED FOR FAKE DATA ELIMINATION

This file previously generated synthetic training data and has been ELIMINATED.
The original emergency_data_generator.py contained 506 lines of fake data generation
including synthetic market data, fake trade outcomes, and artificial scenarios.

üö® REPLACED WITH: real_data_loader.py
üéØ PURPOSE: Enforce real data requirements for all training
‚ö†Ô∏è  NO SYNTHETIC DATA ALLOWED

If you need training data:
1. Use real_data_loader.py to load actual market data from TopstepX
2. Implement real data sources (TopstepX API, historical databases)
3. Load actual trade outcomes from trading history database

SYSTEM WILL NOT OPERATE ON FAKE DATA
