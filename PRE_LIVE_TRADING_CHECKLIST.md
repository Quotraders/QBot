### Phase 8 - Ops & Pre-Live 🟡 PARTIAL
- [x] **Health report implemented**: SimpleBot provides health check output
- [x] **Documentation finalized**: RUNBOOKS.md and PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md updated
- [ ] DRY_RUN rehearsal with live data
- [ ] Fault injection testing (kill-switch, hub disconnect, risk breach)
- [ ] Restart/reconcile scenario testing

## 🎯 Current System Status

### ✅ VERIFIED WORKING COMPONENTS
```bash
# Verified Command (0 errors, 0 warnings)
dotnet run --project SimpleBot/SimpleBot.csproj
