## üéØ Requirements Met

All requirements from the problem statement have been addressed:

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Runs on self-hosted runner | ‚úÖ | `runs-on: self-hosted` in workflow |
| Uses pwsh | ‚úÖ | `shell: pwsh` for all steps |
| Installs Python 3.11 | ‚úÖ | Automatic installation via Chocolatey/apt |
| Installs pip dependencies | ‚úÖ | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Installs Topstep SDK | ‚úÖ | `project-x-py[all]>=3.5.0` from requirements.txt |
| Launches trading bot script | ‚úÖ | `python3.11 bot.py` runs C# bot via dotnet |
| Passes API credentials from Secrets | ‚úÖ | Environment variables from GitHub Secrets |
| Captures stdout/stderr to console | ‚úÖ | Real-time streaming via PowerShell |
| Captures logs to file | ‚úÖ | Timestamped log files in `logs/` directory |

## üîí Security Features

- ‚úÖ **Credentials via GitHub Secrets** - Never exposed in logs or code
- ‚úÖ **Self-hosted runner** - No credentials sent to GitHub's infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **DRY-RUN by default** - Safety first, live trading requires explicit opt-in
- ‚úÖ **Validation before execution** - Checks credentials and SDK before starting
- ‚úÖ **Kill switch support** - Existing `kill.txt` mechanism preserved
- ‚úÖ **Log sanitization** - Sensitive data masked in bot.py

## üìã Setup Checklist

### One-Time Setup (Required)

- [ ] **Add GitHub Secrets** in repository settings:
  - [ ] `TOPSTEPX_API_KEY` - Your TopstepX API key
  - [ ] `TOPSTEPX_USERNAME` - Your TopstepX username
  - [ ] `TOPSTEPX_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your account ID (optional)

- [ ] **Configure self-hosted runner**:
  - [ ] Download and install GitHub Actions runner
  - [ ] Ensure Python 3.11+ is available
  - [ ] Ensure .NET SDK 8.0+ is installed
  - [ ] Ensure runner has internet access for package installation

### Testing

- [ ] **Local test** (on runner machine):
  ```powershell
  # Run setup verification
  .\test-bot-workflow-setup.ps1
  
  # Test bot launcher
  python3.11 bot.py --help
  python3.11 bot.py --dry-run
  ```

- [ ] **Workflow test** (via GitHub Actions):
  - [ ] Go to Actions ‚Üí Topstep Trading Bot ‚Üí Run workflow
  - [ ] Select "dry_run: true" (enabled by default)
  - [ ] Click "Run workflow"
  - [ ] Verify logs and artifacts

## üöÄ Usage

### Manual Execution

**Via GitHub UI:**
1. Navigate to Actions tab
2. Select "ü§ñ Topstep Trading Bot" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure:
   - `dry_run`: ‚úÖ true (safe, recommended)
   - `log_level`: INFO
5. Click "Run workflow" button

**Via GitHub CLI:**
```bash
# DRY-RUN mode (safe)
gh workflow run topstep-bot.yml -f dry_run=true

# Live trading (‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION)
gh workflow run topstep-bot.yml -f dry_run=false
```

### Scheduled Execution

The workflow runs automatically:
- **When**: Monday-Friday at 1:20 PM UTC (9:20 AM ET)
- **Mode**: DRY-RUN (for safety)
- **Duration**: Up to 8 hours (configurable)

### Local Execution

```bash
# On the self-hosted runner machine
python3.11 bot.py --dry-run
```

## üìä Log Management

### During Execution
- Real-time logs visible in GitHub Actions UI
- Logs streamed to console via PowerShell

### After Execution
- Log files uploaded as artifacts: `bot-logs-{run_id}.zip`
- Download from workflow run page
- Retained for 30 days (configurable)

### Log File Format
- Filename: `logs/bot-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
- Content: Timestamped entries with level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Includes: Environment validation, bot startup, trading activity, errors

## üîß Customization

### Change Schedule
Edit `.github/workflows/topstep-bot.yml`:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 14 * * 1-5'  # 2:00 PM UTC (10:00 AM ET)
```

### Change Timeout
```yaml
timeout-minutes: 960  # 16 hours instead of 8
```

### Add Environment Variables
In "Setup Environment Variables" step:
```powershell
"CUSTOM_VAR=value" | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_ENV -Append -Encoding utf8
```

### Change Log Retention
```yaml
retention-days: 60  # 60 days instead of 30
```

## üìö Documentation

- **Primary**: [TOPSTEP_BOT_WORKFLOW.md](TOPSTEP_BOT_WORKFLOW.md)
- **Quick Start**: Run `.\test-bot-workflow-setup.ps1`
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/topstep-bot.yml` (inline comments)
- **Bot Script**: `bot.py` (inline documentation)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow doesn't start**
- Check self-hosted runner is online: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners
- Verify runner service is running

**Missing credentials error**
- Verify GitHub Secrets are set correctly (case-sensitive)
- Check secret names match exactly: `TOPSTEPX_API_KEY`, `TOPSTEPX_USERNAME`

**SDK not found**
- Run setup verification: `.\test-bot-workflow-setup.ps1`
- Manually install: `python3.11 -m pip install 'project-x-py[all]>=3.5.0'`

**Bot fails to start**
- Check .NET SDK is installed: `dotnet --version`
- Verify UnifiedOrchestrator builds: `dotnet build src/UnifiedOrchestrator/`

For more troubleshooting, see [TOPSTEP_BOT_WORKFLOW.md](TOPSTEP_BOT_WORKFLOW.md#troubleshooting).

## ‚ú® Next Steps

1. **Set up GitHub Secrets** (if not already done)
2. **Configure self-hosted runner**
3. **Run verification script**: `.\test-bot-workflow-setup.ps1`
4. **Test workflow manually** with DRY-RUN mode
5. **Review logs** to ensure proper operation
6. **Enable live trading** (optional, when ready)

## üìù Notes

- **DRY-RUN mode is default** - Live trading requires explicit opt-in for safety
- **Logs are retained for 30 days** - Download important logs before expiration
- **Kill switch is preserved** - Create `kill.txt` to force DRY-RUN mode
- **Self-hosted runner recommended** - Keeps credentials secure
- **Scheduled runs use DRY-RUN** - Modify workflow to enable live trading on schedule

## üéâ Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

- ‚úÖ Workflow runs without errors on self-hosted runner
- ‚úÖ Python 3.11 and dependencies install automatically
- ‚úÖ Credentials are loaded from GitHub Secrets
- ‚úÖ Bot launches and validates environment
- ‚úÖ Logs are captured to both console and file
- ‚úÖ Log artifacts are uploaded and accessible
- ‚úÖ DRY-RUN mode prevents accidental live trading
