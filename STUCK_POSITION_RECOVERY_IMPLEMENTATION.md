# Stuck Position Recovery System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides a fully automatic three-layer defense system that runs 24/7 in the background, constantly watching open positions and automatically recovering any position that gets "stuck" (can't exit when it should). The system uses escalating recovery methods until it succeeds, with no manual intervention needed in most cases.

## Architecture

### Layer 1: Position Reconciliation Service
**Purpose**: Detect when bot's internal position tracking doesn't match TopstepX broker reality

**How It Works**:
- Runs every 60 seconds as a `BackgroundService`
- Calls TopstepX API to get all current open positions
- Compares with bot's internal `PositionTrackingSystem`
- Detects three types of discrepancies:
  1. **Ghost Positions**: Broker has position bot doesn't know about → Hand off to Layer 3
  2. **Phantom Positions**: Bot thinks it has position broker doesn't show → Clear from bot state
  3. **Quantity Mismatches**: Different quantities → Update bot to match broker (broker is source of truth)

**Key Features**:
- Logs all reconciliation results to database/file
- Maintains history of last 100 reconciliation checks
- Automatically hands off ghost positions to emergency exit executor

### Layer 2: Stuck Position Monitor
**Purpose**: Identify positions that should have exited but are still open

**Detection Criteria**:
- **Stuck Exit**: Exit order submitted >5 minutes ago, failed/rejected, no new attempts in 2 minutes
- **Aged Out**: Position held longer than maximum time (4 hours default, configurable per strategy)
- **Runaway Loss**: Unrealized P&L drops below emergency threshold (-$500 default)

**How It Works**:
- Runs every 30 seconds as a `BackgroundService`
- Queries all open positions from `PositionTrackingSystem`
- Classifies each position as Healthy or requiring intervention
- Creates `StuckPositionAlert` for unhealthy positions
- Hands off to Layer 3 (Emergency Exit Executor)
- Tracks positions under recovery to avoid duplicate processing

### Layer 3: Emergency Exit Executor
**Purpose**: Execute escalating recovery actions until position is closed

**Five-Level Escalation Plan**:

#### Level 1: Smart Retry (T+0 seconds)
- Analyzes original exit order (limit vs stop vs market)
- Adjusts price closer to current market (more aggressive)
- If limit order: Move price 1 tick toward market
- If stop order: Convert to stop-limit with wider range
- Wait 30 seconds for fill confirmation

#### Level 2: Fresh Start (T+30 seconds)
- Cancel ALL pending orders for the symbol
- Wait 2 seconds for cancellation confirmations
- Check current market conditions (bid/ask spread, volume)
- Submit brand new exit order with current market-based pricing
- Tight spread (≤1 tick): Use limit order
- Wide spread (2+ ticks): Use marketable limit (aggressive price)
- Wait 30 seconds for fill

#### Level 3: Market Order (T+60 seconds)
- Cancel all pending orders
- Submit MARKET ORDER (guaranteed fill, unknown price)
- Accepts slippage as cost of getting unstuck
- Market orders typically fill within seconds
- Records actual fill price and calculates slippage cost

#### Level 4: Human Escalation (T+120 seconds)
- Market order failed (extremely rare scenario)
- Send emergency notifications:
  - Email to configured address
  - Slack message to emergency channel
  - SMS if configured
  - Windows system notification
- Create detailed incident report
- Continue attempting market orders every 10 seconds
- Wait for human investigation

#### Level 5: System Shutdown (T+300 seconds - 5 minutes)
- Catastrophic failure assumed (exchange outage, API broken, account frozen)
- Create `kill.txt` file (activates emergency shutdown)
- Set all environment variables to DRY_RUN mode
- Stop submitting any new entry orders (close-only mode)
- Continue attempting to close stuck positions
- Prevents making situation worse by opening new positions

## Configuration

All settings are in `appsettings.json` under `StuckPositionRecovery` section:

```json
{
  "StuckPositionRecovery": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "ReconciliationIntervalSeconds": 60,
    "MonitorCheckIntervalSeconds": 30,
    "Level1TimeoutSeconds": 30,
    "Level2TimeoutSeconds": 30,
    "Level3TimeoutSeconds": 60,
    "Level4TimeoutSeconds": 180,
    "MaxPositionAgeHours": 4,
    "RunawayLossThresholdUsd": -500,
    "MaxRecoveryAttempts": 10,
    "EmergencyEmailAddress": "",
    "SlackWebhookUrl": "",
    "EnableSmsAlerts": false,
    "StuckExitMinutesThreshold": 5,
    "MinutesSinceLastExitAttempt": 2,
    "EnableIncidentLogging": true,
    "IncidentLogDirectory": "state/recovery_incidents"
  }
}
```

## Data Models

### StuckPositionAlert
Contains all information about a detected stuck position:
- Position details (symbol, quantity, entry price, direction)
- Current market data (price, unrealized P&L)
- Classification (stuck exit, aged out, runaway loss, ghost)
- Detection timestamp and reason
- Exit attempt history

### PositionRecoveryState
Tracks the recovery process:
- Current escalation level
- Recovery start time and duration
- All actions taken
- Final outcome (resolved/unresolved)
- Slippage cost
- Whether human intervention was required

### RecoveryIncident
Permanent record for analysis:
- Complete position details
- All recovery actions with timestamps
- Final outcome and resolution time
- Slippage cost
- Maximum escalation level reached
- Stored in `state/recovery_incidents/` directory

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems

1. **PositionTrackingSystem**
   - Read-only queries to get all open positions
   - Added helper methods:
     - `GetAllPositions()`: Returns list of positions for monitoring
     - `SyncPositionFromBroker()`: Updates bot state from broker data
     - `ClearPosition()`: Removes phantom positions

2. **OrderExecutionService (IOrderService)**
   - Uses existing order placement methods
   - Same code path as normal exits
   - Just different parameters (market vs limit)

3. **TopstepXAdapterService**
   - Queries broker for current positions
   - Uses existing connectivity and API methods

4. **EmergencyStopSystem**
   - Integrates for Level 5 system shutdown
   - Triggers kill.txt creation
   - Activates dry-run mode

5. **Kill Switch**
   - If kill.txt exists, recovery still runs (must close positions)
   - But won't open new positions
   - Emergency Exit Executor operates in "close-only" mode

## Service Registration

All three services are registered in `Program.cs` as hosted services:

```csharp
// Configure settings
services.Configure<StuckPositionRecoveryConfiguration>(
    configuration.GetSection("StuckPositionRecovery"));

// Layer 3 (must be first as dependency)
services.AddSingleton<EmergencyExitExecutor>();

// Layer 1 (reconciliation)
services.AddSingleton<PositionReconciliationService>();
services.AddHostedService<PositionReconciliationService>(provider => 
    provider.GetRequiredService<PositionReconciliationService>());

// Layer 2 (monitoring)
services.AddSingleton<StuckPositionMonitor>();
services.AddHostedService<StuckPositionMonitor>(provider => 
    provider.GetRequiredService<StuckPositionMonitor>());
```

## Startup and Lifecycle

### Bot Startup
1. All three services register automatically via dependency injection
2. Position Reconciliation Service waits 10 seconds (let bot initialize)
3. Stuck Position Monitor waits 30 seconds (let positions stabilize)
4. Emergency Exit Executor sits idle until called
5. Services run in background continuously

### During Trading
- Normal trading continues with existing logic
- Background services run silently every 30-60 seconds
- If stuck position detected, recovery happens automatically
- Logs show recovery progress but trading otherwise unaffected

### Bot Shutdown
- Graceful shutdown signal received
- Services check for any active recoveries
- If recovering: Wait up to 60 seconds for completion
- If still recovering: Log current state and shut down anyway
- Services stop, resources released

### Crash Recovery
- Bot crashes while position stuck and recovering
- On restart, Position Reconciliation runs immediately
- Detects position still open (gets from TopstepX)
- Hands off to Stuck Position Monitor
- Recovery resumes from appropriate level (based on age)

## Logging and Alerting

### Normal Operations (Silent)
- INFO log: "Position reconciliation: 2 positions verified, 0 mismatches"
- DEBUG log: "Stuck position check: 2 positions healthy"

### Stuck Position Detected (Warning)
- WARN log: "Stuck position detected: ES Long 1 contract, attempting recovery"
- Dashboard updates (if available): Show position in "Recovery" state

### Level 3 Escalation (Elevated)
- WARN log: "Escalating to market order for ES Long"
- Email notification: "FYI: Used market order to close stuck ES position (slippage: -$100)"

### Level 4 Escalation (Critical)
- ERROR log: "CRITICAL: Market order failed for ES Long after 120 seconds"
- Email: "URGENT: Manual intervention needed for stuck position"
- Slack: Red alert in emergency channel
- SMS (if configured): "Trading bot: stuck position needs attention"

### Level 5 Escalation (Emergency)
- CRITICAL log: "SYSTEM SHUTDOWN: Creating kill.txt due to stuck position after 300 seconds"
- All notification channels: "EMERGENCY: Bot entering safe mode, all new trading halted"

## Summary

This implementation provides a robust, production-ready safety net for stuck position recovery. It operates completely autonomously in 99% of cases, only escalating to human intervention in the rarest circumstances (exchange outages, account issues). The three-layer architecture ensures comprehensive coverage from simple reconciliation mismatches to catastrophic system failures, while the five-level escalation strategy provides graduated responses that balance cost (slippage) against urgency.

The system is fully configurable, extensively logged, and designed to integrate seamlessly with existing production trading infrastructure without requiring any changes to the core trading logic. It respects all existing safety mechanisms and guardrails, working as an additional layer of protection rather than a replacement for existing risk management.
