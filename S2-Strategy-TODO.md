# S2 Strategy Improvement To-Do List

## Current State

S2 is a robust session VWAP mean-reversion strategy with advanced volatility, trend, and risk logic.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Adaptive Session Windows**

   - Dynamically adjust active time window based on volatility or regime.

2. **Machine Learning Filters**

   - Integrate ML-based pattern recognition for entry/exit or regime classification.

3. **Real-Time News/Event Gating**

   - Add news sentiment or macro event filters to avoid trading during high-impact events.

4. **Dynamic Position Sizing**

   - Use risk-based sizing instead of fixed caps for entries.

5. **Multi-Symbol Correlation**

   - Factor in cross-market signals (ES/NQ/RTY) for confirmation or filtering.

6. **Advanced Order Execution**

   - Add smart order routing, slippage control, and microstructure-aware entry logic.

7. **Backtest/Forward-Test Analytics**
   - Integrate more robust performance analytics and live monitoring.
