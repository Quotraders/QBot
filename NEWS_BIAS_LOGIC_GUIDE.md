# üì∞ News Bias Integration - Complete Logic Documentation

## ‚úÖ PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION

This document explains **exactly** how news sentiment influences trading decisions in the bot.

## üß† How News Forms Trading Bias

### Step 1: Fetch News Context

**When:** Every trading decision (in `MakeIntelligentDecisionAsync()`)  
**Source:** NewsMonitorService polls NewsAPI.org every 5 minutes  
**Data Retrieved:**
- `HasBreakingNews` (boolean): Is there urgent, market-moving news?
- `LatestHeadline` (string): Most recent breaking headline
- `SentimentScore` (0.0 to 1.0): 0.0 = max bearish, 0.5 = neutral, 1.0 = max bullish
- `IsHighVolatilityPeriod` (boolean): Is VIX spiking or unusual market stress?
- `RecentHeadlines` (list): Last 5-10 headlines for context

---

### Step 2: Calculate News Bias

**News Bias Range:** -1.0 (max bearish) to +1.0 (max bullish)

#### Breaking News (HIGH IMPACT)
```csharp
// Full strength bias
newsBias = (sentimentScore - 0.5) * 2.0

Examples:
- Sentiment 0.8 (bullish): newsBias = +0.6 (strong bullish bias)
- Sentiment 0.3 (bearish): newsBias = -0.4 (strong bearish bias)
- Sentiment 0.5 (neutral): newsBias = 0.0 (no bias)
```

#### Recent News (MODERATE IMPACT)
```csharp
// Half strength bias (less aggressive than breaking news)
newsBias = (sentimentScore - 0.5) * 1.0

Examples:
- Sentiment 0.7 (bullish): newsBias = +0.2 (moderate bullish bias)
- Sentiment 0.4 (bearish): newsBias = -0.1 (slight bearish bias)
```

---

### Step 3: Calculate Confidence Multiplier

**Confidence Multiplier Range:** 0.8x to 1.2x (applied to position size + strategy confidence)

#### Breaking News + High Volatility
```
newsConfidenceMultiplier = 0.85x (reduce 15%)
Reason: Wider stops needed, more unpredictable price action
```

#### Breaking News + Normal Volatility
```
newsConfidenceMultiplier = 1.05x (increase 5%)
Reason: Clear directional move, controlled environment = opportunity
```

#### Strong Sentiment (not breaking)
```
newsConfidenceMultiplier = 1.02x (increase 2%)
Reason: Market consensus forming, slight edge
```

#### Weak/Neutral Sentiment
```
newsConfidenceMultiplier = 1.0x (no change)
Reason: No meaningful news context
```

## üéØ How Bias Affects Trading Decisions

### 1. Price Direction Prediction

The bot's LSTM model predicts price direction. News bias adjusts this prediction:

#### Scenario A: News AGREES with Model ‚úÖ
**Example:** Model predicts UP (0.70 probability), News is bullish (+0.6 bias)

```csharp
// Boost probability by up to 10%
probabilityBoost = biasStrength * 0.10
newProbability = min(0.95, 0.70 + 0.06) = 0.76

Result: UP direction, 0.76 probability (increased from 0.70)
```

**Impact:**
- Higher confidence in the trade
- Larger position size (via confidence multiplier)
- More aggressive entry

---

#### Scenario B: News CONFLICTS with Model ‚ö†Ô∏è

##### B1: Moderate Conflict
**Example:** Model predicts UP (0.65 probability), News is bearish (-0.4 bias)

```csharp
// Reduce probability by up to 15%
probabilityReduction = biasStrength * 0.15
newProbability = max(0.50, 0.65 - 0.06) = 0.59

Result: Still UP direction, but 0.59 probability (reduced from 0.65)
```

**Impact:**
- Lower confidence in the trade
- Smaller position size
- More defensive entry

##### B2: Extreme Conflict (Breaking News)
**Example:** Model predicts DOWN (0.68 probability), Breaking news extremely bullish (+0.9 bias)

```csharp
// OVERRIDE model if bias > 0.8 AND breaking news
newDirection = UP
newProbability = 0.60 (modest when overriding)

Result: UP direction (FLIPPED), 0.60 probability
```

**Impact:**
- Bot follows breaking news instead of model
- Rare case (only extreme breaking news)
- Modest position size (uncertainty from model override)

---

### 2. Position Sizing

**Formula:**
```csharp
finalPositionSize = basePositionSize * newsConfidenceMultiplier

Examples:
- Base size: 2 contracts
- Breaking news + high vol: 2 * 0.85 = 1.7 contracts (reduce)
- Breaking news + normal vol: 2 * 1.05 = 2.1 contracts (increase)
- Strong sentiment: 2 * 1.02 = 2.04 contracts (slight increase)
```

---

### 3. Strategy Confidence

**Formula:**
```csharp
finalConfidence = baseStrategyConfidence * newsConfidenceMultiplier

Examples:
- Base confidence: 0.78
- With news multiplier 1.05x: 0.78 * 1.05 = 0.819 (increased)
- With news multiplier 0.85x: 0.78 * 0.85 = 0.663 (decreased)
```

**Impact:**
- Higher confidence = more aggressive trade management
- Lower confidence = tighter risk control

---

### 4. Candidate Filtering

**Process:**
1. Bot generates trade candidates (entries, stops, targets)
2. Candidates filtered by adjusted price direction
3. Only candidates matching news-adjusted direction kept

**Example:**
- Original model: 60% probability UP
- News bias: -0.5 (bearish)
- Adjusted: Still UP but 51% probability (barely)
- **Result:** LONG candidates kept, but low confidence = small size

**vs**

- Original model: 55% probability UP
- News bias: -0.7 (very bearish)
- Adjusted: FLIPPED to DOWN, 60% probability
- **Result:** SHORT candidates only, moderate size

## üìä Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Trump Tariff Tweet
**News:**
- Breaking news: "Trump announces 25% China tariffs"
- Sentiment: 0.2 (very bearish)
- High volatility: YES

**Calculations:**
```
newsBias = (0.2 - 0.5) * 2.0 = -0.6 (strong bearish)
newsConfidenceMultiplier = 0.85x (breaking + high vol)
```

**If Model Says UP:**
```
Original: UP 0.70 probability
News conflicts: Reduce by 0.6 * 0.15 = 0.09
New: UP 0.61 probability (barely)
Position size: Reduced 15%

Bot Decision: Weak LONG or skip trade (low confidence)
```

**If Model Says DOWN:**
```
Original: DOWN 0.68 probability
News agrees: Boost by 0.6 * 0.10 = 0.06
New: DOWN 0.74 probability
Position size: Reduced 15% (high vol caution)

Bot Decision: Strong SHORT with controlled size
```

---

### Example 2: Surprise Fed Pause
**News:**
- Breaking news: "Fed pauses rate hikes, signals dovish turn"
- Sentiment: 0.85 (very bullish)
- High volatility: NO (market calm)

**Calculations:**
```
newsBias = (0.85 - 0.5) * 2.0 = +0.7 (strong bullish)
newsConfidenceMultiplier = 1.05x (breaking + normal vol)
```

**If Model Says UP:**
```
Original: UP 0.72 probability
News agrees: Boost by 0.7 * 0.10 = 0.07
New: UP 0.79 probability
Position size: Increased 5%

Bot Decision: Strong LONG with boosted size
```

**If Model Says DOWN:**
```
Original: DOWN 0.62 probability
News strongly conflicts (0.7 bias > 0.8 threshold? NO)
Moderate reduction: 0.7 * 0.15 = 0.105
New: DOWN 0.515 probability (barely DOWN)
Position size: Increased 5% (news confidence)

Bot Decision: Very weak SHORT or skip (low probability)
```

### Example 3: Routine NFP Beat
**News:**
- Recent news (not breaking): "NFP beats estimate 230k vs 210k"
- Sentiment: 0.65 (moderately bullish)
- High volatility: NO

**Calculations:**
```
newsBias = (0.65 - 0.5) * 1.0 = +0.15 (slight bullish)
sentimentStrength = 0.15 * 2.0 = 0.30 (weak, < 0.6 threshold)
newsConfidenceMultiplier = 1.0x (no adjustment)
```

**Bot Decision:**
- Minimal bias impact (+0.15)
- No confidence adjustment
- Slight preference for LONG if model neutral
- Otherwise follows model prediction

## üîí Safety Guardrails

### 1. News Never Blocks Trades
- Economic calendar blocks trades (FOMC, NFP -10 min)
- News adds context but doesn't prevent execution
- You wanted: "trade during news, don't hide from volatility"

### 2. Model Override Rare
- Only when bias > 0.8 (extreme) AND breaking news
- Probability capped at 0.60 (modest) when overriding
- Position size still controlled by risk management

### 3. Confidence Bounds
- Minimum multiplier: 0.80x (max 20% reduction)
- Maximum multiplier: 1.05x (max 5% increase)
- Never completely eliminates position

### 4. Probability Bounds
- Minimum: 0.50 (coin flip, won't trade below this)
- Maximum: 0.95 (never 100% certain)
- Ensures reasonable risk/reward

## üéØ Summary: What Bot Knows and Does

### Bot Understanding:
‚úÖ **Sentiment Score** ‚Üí Translates to bullish/bearish bias (-1.0 to +1.0)  
‚úÖ **Breaking vs Recent** ‚Üí Stronger bias for breaking news  
‚úÖ **High Volatility** ‚Üí Reduces confidence (wider stops needed)  
‚úÖ **Agreement with Model** ‚Üí Boosts confidence when aligned  
‚úÖ **Conflict with Model** ‚Üí Reduces confidence or overrides if extreme  

### Bot Actions:
‚úÖ **Adjusts price direction probability** (up to ¬±15%)  
‚úÖ **Modifies position size** (0.85x to 1.05x)  
‚úÖ **Filters trade candidates** based on adjusted direction  
‚úÖ **Logs all adjustments** for performance analysis  
‚úÖ **Continues trading** (never blocks, only adjusts)  

### Bot Does NOT Do:
‚ùå Block trades because of news (that's economic calendar's job)  
‚ùå Panic and close positions (news is context, not trigger)  
‚ùå Override model without extreme justification (>0.8 bias + breaking)  
‚ùå Ignore news completely (always considers it)
