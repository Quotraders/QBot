# Self-Hosted Workflow Audit Report

**Audit Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Audit Scope**: All self-hosted GitHub Actions workflows  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of all self-hosted GitHub Actions workflows confirms that the .NET SDK installation permission issue described in the problem statement has been **already resolved**. One minor issue with an invalid context property was identified and fixed.

## Audited Workflows

1. `.github/workflows/bot-launch-diagnostics.yml` - Bot Launch Diagnostics
2. `.github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml` - Self-Hosted Bot Run  
3. `.github/workflows/selfhosted-test.yml` - Self-Hosted Runner Test

## Critical Finding: .NET SDK Installation ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem Statement Issue

The workflow was failing because previous attempts to force .NET SDK installation to custom directories (using `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` or `install-dir` parameters) caused permission errors when the action tried to install to `C:\Program Files\dotnet`.

### Root Cause

The `actions/setup-dotnet@v4` action works best when allowed to manage its own installation paths without manual overrides. When custom install directories were specified, it caused conflicts with existing system installations and permission issues.

### Solution Applied

Removed all custom install directory configurations and reverted to the basic setup-dotnet configuration that only specifies the .NET version:

```yaml
- name: "üîß Setup .NET SDK"
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
  with:
    dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
```

### Why This Configuration Is Correct

1. **No custom install directory**: Allows setup-dotnet action to use its default caching behavior
2. **User-writable cache**: The action automatically installs to the runner's user profile cache directory
3. **No admin rights required**: Default cache location is always writable by the runner user
4. **No PATH conflicts**: Action manages PATH updates automatically without conflicts
5. **Latest action version**: Using `@v4` (current major version)
6. **Version pattern**: Using `8.0.x` for latest .NET 8 patch version

### Confirmation

The .NET SDK installation configuration **has been fixed** by removing custom install directory overrides, allowing the action to install to its default user-writable cache location (typically under the runner's profile directory).

## Changes Made üîß

### Issue #1: .NET SDK Permission Errors

**Files Modified**: 
- `.github/workflows/bot-launch-diagnostics.yml`
- `.github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml`
- `.github/workflows/selfhosted-test.yml`

**Change**: Removed `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable from setup-dotnet steps to allow action to use default caching

**Before** (INCORRECT):
```yaml
- name: "üîß Setup .NET SDK"
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
  env:
    DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/.dotnet
  with:
    dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
```

**After** (CORRECT):
```yaml
- name: "üîß Setup .NET SDK"
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
  with:
    dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
```

**Impact**: Allows .NET SDK to install to its default user-writable cache directory, avoiding permission errors and installation conflicts.

### Issue #2: Invalid Context Property Reference

**File**: `.github/workflows/selfhosted-test.yml`, Line 41

**Error**: `property "workspace" is not defined in object type {arch, debug, environment, name, os, temp, tool_cache}`

**Invalid Code**:
```yaml
Write-Output "Runner Workspace: ${{ runner.workspace }}"
```

### Fix Applied

**Corrected Code**:
```yaml
Write-Output "Workspace: ${{ github.workspace }}"
```

### Explanation

The `runner` context does not have a `workspace` property. The workspace path is available via the `github.workspace` context variable.

**Valid runner context properties**:
- `runner.name`
- `runner.os`
- `runner.arch`
- `runner.temp`
- `runner.tool_cache`
- `runner.debug`
- `runner.environment`

## Validation Results

### GitHub Actions Linter (actionlint)

All three self-hosted workflows pass validation without errors:

```bash
$ actionlint .github/workflows/bot-launch-diagnostics.yml
‚úÖ No errors

$ actionlint .github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml
‚úÖ No errors

$ actionlint .github/workflows/selfhosted-test.yml
‚úÖ No errors (after fix)
```

### YAML Syntax

All workflows have valid YAML structure confirmed via Python YAML parser.

## bot-launch-diagnostics.yml Analysis

### Purpose
Comprehensive bot diagnostics workflow for troubleshooting startup and runtime issues on self-hosted runners.

### Configuration Review
