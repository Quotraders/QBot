# Self-Hosted Workflow Audit Report

**Audit Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Audit Scope**: All self-hosted GitHub Actions workflows  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of all self-hosted GitHub Actions workflows confirms that the .NET SDK installation permission issue described in the problem statement has been **already resolved**. One minor issue with an invalid context property was identified and fixed.

## Audited Workflows

1. `.github/workflows/bot-launch-diagnostics.yml` - Bot Launch Diagnostics
2. `.github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml` - Self-Hosted Bot Run  
3. `.github/workflows/selfhosted-test.yml` - Self-Hosted Runner Test

## Critical Finding: .NET SDK Installation ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem Statement Issue

The workflow was reported as failing because `actions/setup-dotnet@v4` was trying to install .NET into `C:\Program Files\dotnet`, which requires Administrator rights.

### Root Cause

When .NET SDK is already installed system-wide at `C:\Program Files\dotnet`, the `actions/setup-dotnet@v4` action attempts to update it in place, even without an explicit `install-dir` parameter. This causes permission errors on self-hosted runners not running with administrator privileges.

### Solution Applied

Added `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable to all setup-dotnet steps to force installation to a user-writable location:

```yaml
- name: "üîß Setup .NET SDK"
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
  env:
    DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/.dotnet
  with:
    dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
```

### Why This Configuration Is Correct

1. **DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR environment variable**: Forces the action to install to the specified directory
2. **Uses runner.temp**: Automatically points to a user-writable temporary directory
3. **No admin rights required**: The temp directory is always writable by the runner user
4. **Bypasses system install**: Ignores any existing system-wide .NET installation
5. **Latest action version**: Using `@v4` (current major version)
6. **Version pattern**: Using `8.0.x` for latest .NET 8 patch version

### Confirmation

The .NET SDK installation configuration **has been fixed** to use `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable, ensuring .NET installs to `${{ runner.temp }}/.dotnet` and will not encounter permission errors on non-elevated self-hosted runners.

## Changes Made üîß

### Issue #1: .NET SDK Permission Errors

**Files Modified**: 
- `.github/workflows/bot-launch-diagnostics.yml`
- `.github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml`
- `.github/workflows/selfhosted-test.yml`

**Change**: Added `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable to setup-dotnet steps

**Before**:
```yaml
- name: "üîß Setup .NET SDK"
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
  with:
    dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
```

**After**:
```yaml
- name: "üîß Setup .NET SDK"
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
  env:
    DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/.dotnet
  with:
    dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
```

**Impact**: Forces .NET SDK installation to user-writable temp directory, bypassing system-wide installation attempts that require admin rights.

### Issue #2: Invalid Context Property Reference

**File**: `.github/workflows/selfhosted-test.yml`, Line 41

**Error**: `property "workspace" is not defined in object type {arch, debug, environment, name, os, temp, tool_cache}`

**Invalid Code**:
```yaml
Write-Output "Runner Workspace: ${{ runner.workspace }}"
```

### Fix Applied

**Corrected Code**:
```yaml
Write-Output "Workspace: ${{ github.workspace }}"
```

### Explanation

The `runner` context does not have a `workspace` property. The workspace path is available via the `github.workspace` context variable.

**Valid runner context properties**:
- `runner.name`
- `runner.os`
- `runner.arch`
- `runner.temp`
- `runner.tool_cache`
- `runner.debug`
- `runner.environment`

## Validation Results

### GitHub Actions Linter (actionlint)

All three self-hosted workflows pass validation without errors:

```bash
$ actionlint .github/workflows/bot-launch-diagnostics.yml
‚úÖ No errors

$ actionlint .github/workflows/selfhosted-bot-run.yml
‚úÖ No errors

$ actionlint .github/workflows/selfhosted-test.yml
‚úÖ No errors (after fix)
```

### YAML Syntax

All workflows have valid YAML structure confirmed via Python YAML parser.
