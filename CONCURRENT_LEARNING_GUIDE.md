# ü§ñ Concurrent Historical Learning System

## Overview

Your trading bot is now configured to run **historical data learning simultaneously with live trading**. This means:

‚úÖ **During Market Hours**: Bot trades live while learning from historical patterns  
‚úÖ **During Market Closed**: Bot runs intensive historical analysis to improve strategies  
‚úÖ **24/7 Learning**: Continuous improvement whether markets are open or closed  

## How It Works

### üîÑ Concurrent Learning (Market Open)
- Runs every **60 minutes** during live trading
- Uses **7 days** of historical data for lightweight analysis
- Alternates between S2 and S3 strategies to reduce system load
- Low priority execution to not interfere with live trading

### üåô Offline Learning (Market Closed)
- Runs every **15 minutes** when markets are closed
- Uses **30 days** of historical data for comprehensive analysis
- Runs both S2 and S3 strategies simultaneously
- High intensity learning to maximize improvement

### üìä Market Hours Detection
The system automatically detects ES/NQ futures trading hours:
- **Sunday**: Market opens 5:00 PM CT
- **Monday-Thursday**: 24-hour trading with 1-hour break (5-6 PM CT)
- **Friday**: Market closes 4:00 PM CT
- **Saturday**: Markets closed

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Core learning settings
CONCURRENT_LEARNING=1              # Enable concurrent learning
RUN_LEARNING=1                     # Enable background learning
BACKTEST_MODE=1                    # Enable historical backtesting

# Performance tuning
MAX_CONCURRENT_OPERATIONS=2        # Limit concurrent operations
LEARNING_PRIORITY=LOW              # Give live trading priority
LIVE_TRADING_PRIORITY=HIGH         # Prioritize live trading

# Timing settings
CONCURRENT_LEARNING_INTERVAL_MINUTES=60   # Learning frequency during market hours
OFFLINE_LEARNING_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15      # Learning frequency when market closed

# Data settings
CONCURRENT_LEARNING_DAYS=7         # Historical data period for concurrent learning
OFFLINE_LEARNING_DAYS=30           # Historical data period for offline learning
```

## Starting the Bot

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\start-with-learning.ps1
```

### Linux/Mac (Bash)
```bash
./start-with-learning.sh
```

### Manual Start
```bash
cd src/UnifiedOrchestrator
dotnet run
```

## Learning Process

### 1. Strategy Backtesting
- S2 (VWAP Mean Reversion) on ES contracts
- S3 (Bollinger Band Compression) on NQ contracts
- Real historical market data analysis

### 2. Adaptive Learning
- Neural UCB strategy selection optimization
- CVaR-PPO position sizing improvements
- Performance feedback integration

### 3. Model Updates
- Automatic model retraining based on performance
- Live strategy parameter adjustments
- Risk parameter optimization

## Monitoring

### Log Messages
- `üìà [CONCURRENT-LEARNING]` - Learning during market hours
- `üåô [OFFLINE-LEARNING]` - Learning during market closed
- `üîÑ [CONCURRENT-MODE]` - Lightweight concurrent analysis
- `üìä [BACKTEST_LEARNING]` - Historical backtesting in progress

### Performance Impact
- **Market Hours**: Minimal impact on live trading performance
- **Market Closed**: Full system resources dedicated to learning
- **Memory Usage**: Automatically managed and monitored

## Benefits

### üéØ **Continuous Improvement**
- Bot learns from every market condition
- Strategies adapt to changing market patterns
- Performance improves over time

### ‚ö° **Real-Time Adaptation**
- Live trading benefits from historical insights
- Strategy selection becomes more accurate
- Position sizing optimizes based on learned patterns

### üõ°Ô∏è **Risk Management**
- Historical analysis improves risk assessment
- Better understanding of strategy performance
- Adaptive risk controls based on learned behavior

## Safety Features

### üîí **Non-Interference Guarantee**
- Historical learning never blocks live trading decisions
- Separate threads and priority levels
- Automatic resource management

### üö® **Fail-Safe Operation**
- Learning failures don't affect live trading
- Automatic error recovery and retry logic
- Graceful degradation if historical data unavailable

### üìä **Resource Protection**
- Memory usage monitoring and limits
- CPU priority management
- Automatic cleanup of historical data

## Troubleshooting

### Learning Not Starting
1. Check environment variables are set
2. Verify `CONCURRENT_LEARNING=1`
3. Ensure historical data access is available

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce `CONCURRENT_LEARNING_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
2. Decrease `CONCURRENT_LEARNING_DAYS`
3. Monitor system resources

### Historical Data Errors
1. Verify TopstepX JWT token is valid
2. Check network connectivity
3. Review contract ID configuration
