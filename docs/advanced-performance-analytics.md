# Advanced Performance Analytics Roadmap

## Goal
Implement rolling performance analytics for your trading bot, including win rate, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, trade-by-trade P&L, and visualizations (charts, dashboards).

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Extend Journaling Logic
  - Record every trade's entry, exit, side, size, P&L, and timestamp in the journal (e.g., `state/eod_journal.jsonl`).
  - Include additional fields for realized/unrealized P&L, fees, and trade status (open/closed).
  - Calculate rolling win rate, average P&L, max drawdown, and Sharpe ratio from journal data.
  - Store summary stats in a separate file (e.g., `state/performance_summary.json`).

### 2. Implement Analytics Engine
  - Win rate: Number of winning trades / total trades (rolling window).
  - Drawdown: Track equity curve and calculate max drawdown.
  - Sharpe ratio: Use rolling returns and standard deviation.
  - Output a table or chart of each tradeâ€™s P&L, entry/exit, and duration.

### 3. Visualization & Reporting
  - Generate simple charts (e.g., equity curve, drawdown, win rate) using a C# charting library or export to CSV for external tools.
  - Optionally, add a web endpoint (e.g., `/performance`) to serve dashboard data.
  - Write summary stats and trade logs to files for review and analysis.

### 4. Integration & Testing
  - Ensure analytics update on every trade and at EOD.
  - Add health checks for analytics engine.
  - Validate analytics with simulated trades before going live.

- Real-time Alerts: Notify on new highs/lows, large drawdowns, or streaks (via email/SMS/webhook).
- **Automated Backtest Reports:** Generate full reports after each backtest run, including charts and stats.
- **Strategy Parameter Tracking:** Log and analyze strategy parameters alongside performance for optimization.
- **Voice/Chatbot Interface:** Query analytics and get reports via voice or chat.
- **Automated Strategy Tuning:** Use reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms to optimize strategy parameters.
- **Plug-in Marketplace:** Allow third-party analytics modules and custom visualizations.

- **Custom Branding & White-Labeling:** Allow organizations to brand the analytics dashboard and reports.
- **AI-Powered Trade Insights:** Use machine learning to analyze trade patterns and suggest optimizations.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Forecast future performance, risk, or market conditions using historical data.
- **Natural Language Reports:** Generate plain-English summaries of performance and trade history.
- **Voice/Chatbot Interface:** Query analytics and get reports via voice or chat.
- **Automated Strategy Tuning:** Use reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms to optimize strategy parameters.
- **Sentiment & News Integration:** Incorporate market sentiment and news analytics into performance dashboards.
- **Social/Community Analytics:** Compare performance with peer groups or community benchmarks.
- **Gamification:** Add achievement badges, leaderboards, and progress tracking for trading goals.
- **Plug-in Marketplace:** Allow third-party analytics modules and custom visualizations.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Automatically flag unusual trades, outlier P&L, or abnormal drawdowns.
- **Session/Day/Week Analytics:** Summarize performance by session, day, or week for deeper insights.
- **Risk Heatmaps:** Visualize risk exposure over time or by strategy.
- **Trade Replay:** Allow replaying historical trades for review and debugging.
- **Mobile-Friendly Dashboard:** Add a responsive dashboard for mobile monitoring.
- **API for External Tools:** Expose analytics via REST API for integration with other platforms.
- **Multi-Account Support:** Track and compare analytics across multiple trading accounts.
- **User Roles & Permissions:** Add access control for analytics dashboard (admin/viewer roles).
- **Automated Backtest Reports:** Generate full reports after each backtest run, including charts and stats.
- **Strategy Parameter Tracking:** Log and analyze strategy parameters alongside performance for optimization.

- Real-time Alerts: Notify on new highs/lows, large drawdowns, or streaks (via email/SMS/webhook).
- Custom Metrics: Add expectancy, profit factor, and risk-adjusted returns.
- Strategy Attribution: Break down analytics by strategy, symbol, or time window.
- Trade Tagging: Allow tagging trades (e.g., setup type, market condition) for deeper analysis.
- Benchmark Comparison: Compare bot performance to benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500, buy-and-hold).
- Data Export: Support exporting analytics to CSV/Excel for external review.
- User Configurable Windows: Let users set rolling window sizes for stats.

## Recommendations
- Start by updating the journal format and trade logging.
- Build aggregation and analytics logic as a separate module/class.
