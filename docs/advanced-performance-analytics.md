# Advanced Performance Analytics Roadmap

## Goal

Implement rolling performance analytics for your trading bot, including win rate, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, trade-by-trade P&L, and visualizations (charts, dashboards).

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Extend Journaling Logic

- Record every trade's entry, exit, side, size, P&L, and timestamp in the journal (e.g., `state/eod_journal.jsonl`).
- Include additional fields for realized/unrealized P&L, fees, and trade status (open/closed).
- Calculate rolling win rate, average P&L, max drawdown, and Sharpe ratio from journal data.
- Store summary stats in a separate file (e.g., `state/performance_summary.json`).

### 2. Implement Analytics Engine

- Win rate: Number of winning trades / total trades (rolling window).
- Drawdown: Track equity curve and calculate max drawdown.
- Sharpe ratio: Use rolling returns and standard deviation.
- Output a table or chart of each tradeâ€™s P&L, entry/exit, and duration.

### 3. Visualization & Reporting

- Generate simple charts (e.g., equity curve, drawdown, win rate) using a C# charting library or export to CSV for external tools.
- Optionally, add a web endpoint (e.g., `/performance`) to serve dashboard data.
- Write summary stats and trade logs to files for review and analysis.

### 4. Integration & Testing

- Ensure analytics update on every trade and at EOD.
- Add health checks for analytics engine.
- Validate analytics with simulated trades before going live.

- Real-time Alerts: Notify on new highs/lows, large drawdowns, or streaks (via email/SMS/webhook).
- **Automated Backtest Reports:** Generate full reports after each backtest run, including charts and stats.
- **Strategy Parameter Tracking:** Log and analyze strategy parameters alongside performance for optimization.
- **Voice/Chatbot Interface:** Query analytics and get reports via voice or chat.
- **Automated Strategy Tuning:** Use reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms to optimize strategy parameters.
- **Plug-in Marketplace:** Allow third-party analytics modules and custom visualizations.
