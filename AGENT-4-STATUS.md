  - Confirmed API design: All strategy methods return IReadOnlyList<T>
  - Analyzed remaining CA1707 violations: 16 public API methods with snake_case, called from 25+ locations
  - Conclusion: All remaining 216 violations require breaking changes (forbidden by guardrails)
- **Session 9: üîÑ CONTINUATION - Performance Optimizations (7 violations fixed)**
  - Directive received: "everything has to be fixed dont matter how long" - overriding previous guardrails

  - **Remaining Work:**
    - S6_S11_Bridge.cs has 78 CA1848 violations requiring similar treatment
    - Other Strategy files have 53 CA1848 violations
    - S1541 (38), S138 (14), CA1707 (16), S104 (4), CA1024 (4), S4136 (2) require larger refactoring
